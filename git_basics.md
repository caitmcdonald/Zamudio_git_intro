# Git and Github basics

## What is version control?

- Version control (sometimes known as revision control) is a method of recording changes to files or documents over time so that you can access previous versions.
- At its most basic sense, version control has been around since writing has been around (e.g. editions of books).
- Today we talk about version control mostly with regard to computers.
- In fact, basically everyone uses version control, you just might not know to call it that. Every time you save a copy of a file, e.g. mydoc_v1, mydoc_v2, you're performing version control!
- Lots of computer programs have built-in version control capabilities (which is why Microsoft Word will recover an unsaved document if it crashes).
- Version control is super important in a lot of fields (e.g. graphic design, architecture, web design, pretty much anything to do with comp sci), and it can make your life as a biologist a lot easier.

## What is Git?
- Git is the most popular 'version control system' (VCS) today.
- It's a 'distributed version control system.'
- It's open-source.
- There are two types of version control systems: centralized and distributed.
    - Centralized: older, not very common, requires a central server that is accessed by all users/clients.
    - Distributed: newer, very common, complete codebase with full revision history is mirrored on everyone's computer.
- Why are distributed VCSs better?
    - Safer
    - Faster operations
    - Better offline ability

## What is Github?
- Github is a cloud-based platform built around Git.
- It is *not* open-source (Microsoft bought it for $7.5 billion), but you can create a free account.
- It's an online service that allows users who have Git installed locally to connect and upload/download resources.
- Functionally, it's a way to share your projects with others online.

## So...why use Git and Github?
- Open science is cool! You can learn a lot from cruising around other people's projects, and they can learn a lot from you.
- More and more journals are requiring that your data and the analyses you used be openly accessible, and Github is a good place to start.
- If you find yourself revising files often, forgetting what you did, or misplacing them, Git is an amazing resource. It will keep you, and your projects, organized.
- Most people use it for coding, but you can use it for basically anything (for example, let's say you're optimizing a wet lab protocol).
- An added bonus: Github offers free web hosting, so it's a great option for personal websites.
