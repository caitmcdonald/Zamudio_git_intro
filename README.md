# Zamudio lab Git/Github intro

This repo contains documents and links to tutorials that will help you get started using Git and Github:

1. [What are Git and Github?](git_basics.md)
1. [Installing Git, creating a Github account, interfacing between the two](installing_git.md)
1. [Basic Git commands](basic_git_commands.md)

This repo is by no means exhaustive, and I am by no means an expert! Here are some other great resources:

- Karl Broman's [tutorials](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/) (I have links to many of these--they're pretty bare bones)
- Git [doc files](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- The [ebook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) version of this Git documentation
- Github [tutorials](https://services.github.com/#offerings)
- Github [guides](https://guides.github.com/)
